# ðŸ”¹ RGB LED Control on Pins 11, 10, and 9

Why stick to one color when you can have the full rainbow? This project controls an RGB LED through PWM on pins 11, 10, and 9, letting you mix colors like you're the Picasso of electronics.

## Technologies Utilized:

- Arduino (C/C++)
- RGB LED
- PWM Control
- Resistors & Basic Electronics
